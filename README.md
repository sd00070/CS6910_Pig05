> For some reason, the git CLI wanted me to recommit many of the files in the initial commit. The initial commit contained all of the files, and git diff did not outline any changes, but the CLI still wanted me to recommit them for some reason. I really don't know why.

> As to not accidentally lose something, I've decided to recommit the files in order to satisfy the CLI. I really hope it doesn't cause problems down the line.
